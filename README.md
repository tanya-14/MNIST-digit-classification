# MNIST-digit-classification

The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database[1]) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.[2][3] The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.[4][5] It was created by "re-mixing" the samples from NIST's original datasets.[6] The creators felt that since NIST's training dataset was taken from American Census Bureau employees, while the testing dataset was taken from American high school students, it was not well-suited for machine learning experiments.[7] Furthermore, the black and white images from NIST were normalized to fit into a 28x28 pixel bounding box and anti-aliased, which introduced grayscale levels.
